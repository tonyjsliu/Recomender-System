Movie recommender System is recommending movies to users based on their rating history. This data come from Netflix and is about 2 gigabytes. There are two algorithms for recommender system, one is user collaborative filtering, second is item collaborative filtering. User collaborative filtering is based on the similarity between users calculated using people’s ratings of movies. This algorithm suits for small people and more movies. Item collaborative filtering is based on the similarity between items calculated using people’s rating of movies. I use the second one. Because users are more than movies and using user’s historical data is more convincing. Based on the idea that if one user rated two movies then these movies are related, I use rating history to build relationship between movies which is co-occurrence matrix. Then each user has a rating matrix, which contains all movies and ratings. For the movies that user haven’t seen, I use the average value of other movies that he has seen instead. Then I multiply co-occurrence matrix and rating matrix, and gain movie recommender list for each user. Since this size is too big, I store them with amazon S3, and use Amazon EMR to do map reduce.
